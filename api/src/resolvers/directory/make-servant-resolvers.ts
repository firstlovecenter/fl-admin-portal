/**
 * Servant Resolvers - Generated via Factory Pattern
 *
 * BEFORE: 200+ lines of manual, repetitive resolver definitions
 * AFTER: 15 lines that leverage declarative configuration
 *
 * To add a new mutation? Simply add one line to servant-config.ts.
 * That's it. No manual resolver boilerplate needed.
 *
 * Philosophy: Configuration + Factory = Maintainability + Scalability
